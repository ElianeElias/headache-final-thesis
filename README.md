Background
Headache is a prevalent issue that prompts patients to seek medical help worldwide. It
is a leading cause of disability, surpassing other neurological problems. It is estimated
that nearly half of all adults have experienced a headache within the past year. [1]
It is crucial for healthcare providers to distinguish between primary and secondary
headaches in order to promptly address more serious causes, leading to improved
quality of life and reduced disability. [2]
Primary headaches are headaches that do not stem from any structural abnormalities in
the intracranial region, unlike secondary headaches. Primary headache pain typically
recurs in a specific pattern and is often triggered. Usually, there are no symptoms at all
between attacks of a typical primary headache. Headaches can be secondary, especially
if they occur shortly after previous symptoms or other causes. [3,4]
The classification system developed by the Headache Classification Committee of the
International Headache Society (IHS) categorizes headaches into primary, secondary,
and cranial neuralgia. There are various types of primary headaches, including migraine,
tension-type headache, cluster headache with trigeminal/autonomic cephalgia, and other
primary headaches. [5]
There are several types of primary headache disorders, such as migraine, tension-type
headache (TTH), trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs), and other primary
headache disorders. Secondary headaches encompass a range of conditions, such as
intracranial space-occupying lesions (SOLs), infections of the central nervous system
like meningitis or encephalitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, giant-cell arteritis, cerebral
venous thrombosis, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. [6]

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD2010) highlighted the high prevalence
of TTH as a disorder worldwide, with migraine closely following. However, when it comes
to causing disability migraine surpasses TTH significantly. [7]
Need for the study
Headache is a significant cause of morbidity globally, yet it has received little attention in
developing countries. The majority of clinical and epidemiological studies have been
conducted in developed countries. However, there is limited literature available to
support treatment guidelines or public health interventions for managing headaches in
low- and middle-income countries, which are home to 85% of the global population. [8,9]
Despite the prevalence of headaches as a medical complaint, many cases still go
undiagnosed and untreated in practice. Even in modern times, some physicians still
believe that there are limited options available for patients suffering from headaches. It's
worth noting that the field of headache research has made significant progress in the
past decade. Over 90% of the headaches observed in practice are now recognized as
primary headaches, which means they are genuine biological issues that can potentially
be treated. This evidence underscores the importance of understanding and addressing
primary headaches. [10] It is crucial for clinicians to avoid any mistakes when it comes to
making accurate diagnoses and selecting the appropriate treatment options.
Understanding the headache patterns of patients seen in specialized medical centers
can greatly assist in improving the diagnostic and treatment procedures at lower levels
of care. This knowledge can lead to more effective and tailored treatment for these cases.

Problem Statement
This study aims to document the patients who present with various types of primary
headaches in the Bundelkhand region. It also aims to understand their clinical profile and
diagnostic methods. The ultimate objective is to effectively allocate resources for
improved patient care and prevention.
